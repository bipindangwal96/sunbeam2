* command name: "grep" -- globally search regular expression and print
	- grep searches for pattern/string/expression in file/files/filesystem structure and
	bydefault grep prints the matching line.
	- egrep <=> grep -E
	- fgrep <=> grep -F
	- rgrep <=> grep -r
	
	- following options can be used with grep command:
		-i -- ignore case distinctions
		-v -- invert the sense of matching
		-w -- select only those lines containing matches that form whole words.
		-x -- select only those matches that exactly match the whole line
		-y -- obsolete synonym for -i
	
	$grep "java" sunbeam.txt --> prints the lines matches with the pattern
	$grep -n "java" sunbeam.txt --> prints the lines matches with line numbers
	$grep -c "java" sunbeam.txt --> supress normal output; instead print a count of matching
	line for each input files, with -v option prints non-matching lines
	
	$grep -w "program" sunbeam.txt --> prints the lines containg matches that form whole word
	$grep -A2 "device" sunbeam.txt --> prints two line after match is found including match line
	$grep -B2 "device" sunbeam.txt --> prints two line before match is found including match line
	$grep -C2 "device" sunbeam.txt --> prints two line after as well as before match is found
	including match line.

	$fgrep "b*g" select.txt OR grep -F "b*g" select.txt
 
	+ "repetition operators":
		? -- at most once

		{,m} -- atmost m no. of occurences
		{n,m} -- more than or equal to n and less than or equal to m.
